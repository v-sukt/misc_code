solving boolean logic problems
---------------------------------

#. Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
#. Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
#. Find each not and invert it.
#. Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
#. When you are done you should have True or False.
