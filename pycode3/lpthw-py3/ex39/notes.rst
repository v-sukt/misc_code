dictionaries
-------------

Python dictionaries are like real world dictionaries.
They map data to another data.
So they are useful when you have to lookup one thing and
get mapped thing from the object.

    Dictionaries is not ordered data structure unlike lists.
    To use ordered dictionaries use ``collections.OrderedDict``
