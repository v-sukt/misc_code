Some operations that cna be done on strings :

addition (in terms of string it's concatenation):
    str1 = "This"
    str2 = "is"
    str3 = "soooo"
    str4 = "good"
    combined = str1 + str2 + str3 + str4  # results in 'Thisissoooogood'
    combined_ = str1 + " " + str2 + " " + str3 + " " + str4  # results in 'This is soooo good'

multiplication (in terms of string it repetition )
    def pretty_title(title, sep):
        formatted_title = sep * len(title) + "\n" + title + "\n" + sep * len(title)
        print(formatted_title)
    pretty_title("My text title", "*")
