class Name(object)
-------------------

Python3 doesn't need you to add ``(object)`` to the ``class`` declaration. But as
per experts *Explicit* declaration is better than *implicit* declaration.
As per *Zen of Python* **explicit is better than implicit!**

*is-a* relationship - between the classes and objects or classes and their parent/child class
- Employee is-a Person
- Lion is-a CarnivorousAnimal
*has-a* relationship - between the object or class and it's attributes(contents) or methods (functions within class body)
- Employee has-a EmployeeCode, MobileNo, Gender, Address
- Lion has-a Fangs, Claws
