Some code from Learn the C hard way and documented notes in exXX.txt or in the C program directly

Something about C, before starting:
The Core Competencies
I’m going to guess that you have experience using a lesser language. One of those usable languages 
that lets you get away with sloppy thinking and half-baked hackery like Python or Ruby. Or, maybe 
you use a language like LISP that pretends the computer is some purely functional fantasy land with 
padded walls for little babies. Maybe you’ve learned Prolog, and you think the entire world should 
just be a database where you walk around in it looking for clues. Even worse, I’m betting you’ve 
been using an integrated development environment (IDE), so your brain is riddled with memory holes, 
and you can’t even type an entire function’s name without hitting CTRL-SPACE after every three characters.
No matter what your background is, you could probably use some improvement in these areas:

    *Reading and Writing*
    This is especially true if you use an IDE, but generally I find programmers do too much skimming 
    and have problems reading for comprehension. They’ll just skim code that they need to understand 
    in detail without taking the time to understand it. Other languages provide tools that let 
    programmers avoid actually writing any code, so when faced with a language like C, they break down.
    The simplest thing to do is just understand that everyone has this problem, and you can fix it by
    forcing yourself to slow down and be meticulous about your reading and writing. At first, it’ll 
    feel painful and annoying, but take frequent breaks, and then eventually it’ll be easier to do.

    *Attention to Detail*
    Everyone is bad at this, and it’s the biggest cause of bad software. Other languages let you get away 
    with not paying attention, but C demands your full attention because it’s right in the machine, and 
    the machine is very picky. With C, there is no “kind of similar” or “close enough,” so you need 
    to pay attention. Double check your work. Assume everything you write is wrong until you prove 
    it’s right.

    *Spotting Difference*
    Your brain may be trained in spotting the difference in other languages, you need to train it 
    for C too, so you can spot issues while coding or reading the code.
    
    *Planning and Debugging*
    In other languages you can keep on hacking till it works.. C is hard on you as it requires you to 
    plan first before coding. Even just a little planning can smooth things out down the road. 
    Learning C makes you a better programmer because you are forced to deal with these issues earlier
    and more frequently. You can’t be sloppy about what you write or nothing will work. The advantage
    of C is that it’s a simple language that you can figure out on your own, which makes it a great 
    language for learning about the machine and getting stronger in these core programming skills.

So to Excercises...
