Dear Sir/Madam,

This is regarding the updation of details in case of mobile number loss/inactivation due to some reason.

As it's possible to use the biometric for attaching the mobile number to aadhar card, please check if it's feasible/possible to update the new mobile number replacing the old one - when the number is lost/deactivated.

Having visited 2-3 nearby centres everywhere I was told to visit in December to take appointment to change the mobile number, in case of lost of mobile number waiting for 2 months to get appointment to update to new one would not make sense.
Please check if this can be done, that'll be very helpful. 

Regards,

Rajshekhar
