Check the following codes and the projects related to this:

• The Django Tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01) and try to build a 
  web application with the Django Web Framework (https://www.djangoproject.com).

• SciPy (http://www.scipy.org), if you’re into science, math, and engineering and also Dexy (http://dexy.it), 
  for when you want to write awesome papers that incorporate SciPy or any code really.
• PyGame (http://www.pygame.org/news.html) and see if you can make a game with graphics and sound.
• Pandas (http://pandas.pydata.org) for doing data manipulation and analysis.
• Natural Language Tool Kit (http://nltk.org) for analyzing written text and writing things like spam filters 
   and chat bots.
• Requests (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/index.html) to learn the client side of HTTP and the web.
• SimpleCV (http://simplecv.org) to play with making your computer see things in the real world.
• ScraPy (http://scrapy.org) and try scraping some websites to get information off them.
• Panda3D (https://www.panda3d.org) for doing 3D graphic and games.
• Kivy (http://kivy.org) for doing user interfaces on desktops and mobile platforms.
• SciKit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable) for machine learning applications.
• Ren’Py (http://renpy.org) for doing interactive fiction games, similar to what you’ve built in this book but 
  with pictures.
• Learn C the Hard Way (http://c.learncodethehardway.org) after you’re familiar with Python and try learning C
   and algorithms with my other book. Take it slow; C is different but a very good thing to learn.

Learning to Program:
1. Get a book or some introductory text about the language.
2. Go through the book and type in all the code, making it run.
3. Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes.
4. Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language.
5. Read other people’s code in the language, and try to copy their patterns

The final thing to remember about learning a new language: don’t be a stupid tourist. A stupid tourist is someone 
who goes to another country and then complains that the food isn’t like the food at home. “Why can’t I get a good 
burger in this stupid country!?” When you’re learning a new language, assume that what it does isn’t stupid—it’s 
just different—and embrace it so you can learn it.

One more thing...
After you learn a language though, don’t be a slave to that language’s way of doing things. Sometimes the people 
who use a language actually do some very idiotic things for no other reason than “that’s how we’ve always done it.” 
If you like your style better and you know how everyone else does it, then feel free to break their rules if it 
improves things.

Some Advice from an old programmer:
• Programming as an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can 
create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite 
this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.
• Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same 
money and be happier running a fast food joint. You’re much better off using code as your secret weapon in another 
profession.
• People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code 
in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing 
things to advance those disciplines.
